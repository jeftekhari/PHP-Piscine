This was a fun week of learning PHP. I have never had any web development prior to this and it was a great introduction. Everyone gives PHP a hard time, but I enjoyed learning it. Maybe I'll understand why it's looked down upon in the future. My website turned out great, despite not being able to use SQL as a resource. You may be wondering why I didn't attempt the final week of this 2-week course. The fact is that a hackathon I wanted to participate in was coming up, and I needed to prepare by doing the docker projects. So I prioritized my time and was able to pass the piscine and complete the docker exercises at the same time.
